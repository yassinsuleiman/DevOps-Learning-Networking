	1.	Goals & Objectives
	2.	Required Tasks & Assignments
	3.	GitHub Repository Setup
	4.	LinkedIn Engagement
	5.	Important Reminders

⸻

🎯 Goals & Objectives
	•	Master Networking Fundamentals: Understand IP addressing, DNS, routing, switches, routers, firewalls, ports & protocols.
	•	Hands-On Deployment: Purchase a domain, launch an EC2 instance, install NGINX, map your domain via Cloudflare or Route 53.
	•	Career Portfolio: Showcase your work on GitHub and share your learning journey on LinkedIn.

⸻

📝 Required Tasks & Assignments

1️⃣ Networking Learning
	•	Watch all video tutorials in the Skool Networking module.
	•	Complete practical exercises and quizzes.
	•	Participate in discussion threads; ask questions when stuck.

2️⃣ Domain & EC2 Deployment
	•	Buy your own domain (e.g. via Cloudflare or AWS Route 53).
	•	Launch an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023, t3.micro).
	•	Install NGINX, configure on port 80.
	•	Add an A record in Cloudflare/Route 53 pointing to your EC2 IP.
	•	Verify by visiting http://<your-domain> and seeing your NGINX page.

3️⃣ GitHub Repository
	•	Create a repo named DevOps-Learning-Networking.
	•	Add this README.md.
	•	Upload all your configs, scripts, and notes.

4️⃣ LinkedIn Engagement

Craft 3 LinkedIn posts tagging @CoderCo:
	1.	Post 1: Reflections on Networking fundamentals and why they matter for DevOps.
	2.	Post 2: A challenge you overcame (e.g. DNS propagation or NGINX config) including snippet of the key command.
	3.	Post 3: Showcase your GitHub repo with a summary of what you learned.

🙋‍♂️ My Experience

This Networking module challenged me to dive deep into the inner workings of the Internet. I completed video lectures on TCP/IP, OSI layers, DNS internals, routing protocols, and subnetting. Hands-on labs pushed me to troubleshoot real-world scenarios: configuring /etc/hosts, using nslookup and dig, and isolating connectivity issues with ping and traceroute. Deploying my own NGINX server on EC2 and mapping a custom domain solidified my understanding of DNS records, A-record propagation, and web server configuration.

🛠️ Skills Acquired
	•	IP Addressing & Subnetting: Calculated subnets using CIDR notation and applied NAT.
	•	DNS Configuration: Managed zone files, record types, and debugging nameserver lookups.
	•	Routing Fundamentals: Differentiated between static and dynamic routing, and understood common routing protocols.
	•	Network Troubleshooting: Used ping, traceroute, nslookup, and dig to diagnose network issues.
	•	Web Server Deployment: Installed, configured, and secured NGINX on AWS EC2.
	•	Infrastructure-as-Code Awareness: Gained initial exposure to automating network deployments in cloud environments.

⸻

✅ Recap
	•	Completed all Networking video tutorials and slides.
	•	Built a functional NGINX web server on EC2.
	•	Pointed custom domain yassinnginx.uk via DNS A-record.
	•	Documented troubleshooting steps and best practices.
	•	Shared progress on GitHub and LinkedIn.
